I decided to start studying programming because I was realy fascinated by technology and 
I was particularly interested in how computers work. So I decided to apply in computer science
at Sofia Universety. After I started learning programing I knew I had chosen the right
thing for me because I found programming to be absolutely amazing. It combined logical
and creative thinking - two of the things I'm quite good at.

I'm mostly motovated by the fact that the there are a lot of things that i find realy intresting
and i can learn. All the new, futuristic, cool looking stuff is absolutley amazing and I'm compelled
to throw myself in the deep waters of technology and programming. I really want to be a part of this
world.

I decided to apply to this course because I expect it to be challenging. I expect hard problems
and to learn intresting and cool algorithms.
